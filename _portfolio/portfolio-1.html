<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
I worked on a project that integrated object detection, lane detection, depth estimation, and planning algorithms 
to develop an autonomous driving system. Through the perception stage, we processed the obtained information to generate an 
occupancy map and planned the control process accordingly.
</p>

</p>

<p>
For object detection, we used <strong>YOLOv8</strong>, while <strong>UFLD</strong> was used for lane detection, 
and <strong>Metric3D</strong> for depth estimation. In the planning stage, we implemented path generation using the 
<strong>A* algorithm</strong>.
</p>

<p>
To improve inference speed, we converted the <strong>PyTorch</strong> models to <strong>TensorRT</strong>. 
After developing the object, lane, depth, and planning engines, we integrated them into a single unified engine.
We named the unified engine as the <strong>Autonomous Engine</strong>.
</p>

<p>
For our project, we used the Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano 8GB, Nvidia JetRacer, and a CSI camera. 
While driving the JetRacer, we collected a total of 11,243 images. After capturing the data, we manually 
labeled objects and lanes before conducting experiments.

<p>This is a visualization of the results when running the Autonomous Engine.</p>

<p>During this project, the vehicle had difficulty accurately detecting lanes, so we used <strong>ResNet</strong> to train 
    the direction it should follow. This video visualizes the results.</p>

    <strong>üßë‚Äçüíª My Role:</strong> Led the development of <strong>object detection</strong> and <strong>lane detection</strong> modules, and implemented the integration of all perception-planning-control components into a unified <strong>Autonomous Engine</strong>. Also managed data collection and labeling. 
    Additionally, I delivered a presentation of the project at the deepdaiv Open Seminar.
